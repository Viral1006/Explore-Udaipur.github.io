    It doesn‚Äôt matter how many countries you visit, you‚Äôll always have a special place in your heart for
    your own. Like for me, it always has and will be ‚ÄúMera Bharat Mahan‚Äù.And when it comes to a place you
    grew up carrying loads of memories to cherish forever, it automatically occupies that soft corner of
    your soul.<br>
    Cherry on the top, to have been brought up in a city filled with eternal beauty and everything
    magical around, it becomes a blessing in disguise for you to even be its minutest part.

    The city of Udaipur formed the capital of the erstwhile Kingdom of Mewar, as per old Indian history.
    This was a short trip and we were hard-pressed with time. So we decided on ‚Äúminimum hotel time and
    maximum street hours‚Äù during our two days trip to Udaipur. Mewar is a hilly and invigorating green part
    of Rajasthan. It lies in the windward side of the mighty Aravallis- one of the oldest mountains in the world.</pre><br>

    <pre>
    So to describe it, a place, which is famous for its Rajput-era palaces and scenic locations, a place which is on
    the bucket list of so many tourists, a place where many plan their dream destination weddings, a place that carries
    a wide history and culture with it and is known by the names the City of Lakes, Venice of the East, and the Kashmir
    of Rajasthan. You are right; it is none other than, <b>Udaipur, the city where my heart lies.</b> <br>
    So is the city all about lakes? Obviously not!! Udaipur has each and every ingredient which can relish its visitors.
    Forts, palaces, museums, temples, hills, zoo, gardens, forest, fountains, statutes, beautiful hotels, malls, fairs,
    and what not!!  This city has the power to make you forget all your worries and feel like this is the only
    place where you truly belong to.</pre>

         <h2>Getting around Udaipur city</h2>
    <pre>
    The city is small and the best way to explore it is by strolling through the streets(mainly areas surrounding
    the old city). For a few of the places, you will need a transport. Auto rickshaws are generally expensive and
    a lot will depend on your bargaining skills; Ola/ Uber are a far better option.<br>
    If you are good with fitness and love riding bicycle, there cannot be a better option. Cycles are easily available
    on rent; check out PEDL by Zoomcar and MYBYK. Tired of cycling, another good option will be renting a motorbike.
    Check out bike rental services in Udaipur. You can choose the one which you find affordable.</pre>

   <h3> Fatehsagar Lake</h3>
<pre>
   A trip to Udaipur is loaded and this makes planning a short trip here a Herculean task. Nevertheless, hoping that
   we do not miss the crucial spots, our next in the list was Fateh Sagar Lake. Named after Maharana Fateh Singh,
   this is another artificial freshwater lake created in the 1680s. The lake has several islands, the largest being
   a park called the Nehru Park.

  Popularly known as FS among the locals, this lake is the heart and soul of every Udaipurite and indeed the most
  happening place in Udaipur. After a long day at work, it‚Äôs the perfect place to sit back and relax.
  View of the sunset from here is just mesmerizing.</pre>

<h3>City Palace</h3>
<pre>
  Built over a period of nearly 400 years, a visit to the Palace is a must if you want to dig deeper into the rich history
  of Mewar kingdom and all of its rulers. You can enter the complex through Badi Pol, or the Sheetla Mata Gate.
  The palace towers on the banks of Lake Pichola and thus gives a beautiful view of the lake and the surrounding
  city. A light and sound show is organized at Manek Chowk from 7 pm to 8 pm.</pre>

<h3>Sajjangarh palace</h3>
<pre>
  Also known as the Monsoon palace, it is situated at the top of a hill and provides a perfect panoramic view of
  the city. It was built basically to watch the monsoon clouds. The view of the sunset from this palace is stunning.
  The Palace is illuminated in the evenings, giving a glow of a mixed yellow-white. Timings to visit: 9:30 am to 7 pm;
  Charges: INR 100.

  On your visit to the Monsoon Palace, you can also visit Sajjangarh Biological Park which is located just beneath
  the palace.</pre>

<h3>Bagore Ki Haveli and Gangaur Ghat</h3>
<pre>
  Located on the edge of Lake Pichola, it is a mansion built in the 18th century having over 100 rooms which display
  the modern art, royal paintings, crafts, and costumes of the Rajasthani culture. A cultural folk dance program
  Dharohar is held every day from 7 pm to 8 pm. The charges for the same are INR 90 (Indian National) and INR 150
  (Foreign national), but it‚Äôs absolutely worth it.</pre>

  Doodh Talai Lake, Fish Aquarium, Deendayal Upadhyay Park, Crystal gallery, Maharana Pratap Memorial, Chetak
  Smarak, Nehru garden, Rajiv Gandhi Park to name a few. I am not going to cover these places in details,

<b>Best time to visit Udaipur</b>

  Just try to avoid visiting Udaipur in the summer months of April to June as scorching heat is prevalent in the
  whole region. The best months to visit Udaipur are from October to December as the monsoon season would
  have already left the city lush green.</pre>
